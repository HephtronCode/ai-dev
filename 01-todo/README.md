# Django To-Do List Application

A simple, yet powerful To-Do List web application built with Python and the Django Web Framework. This project is designed to be a straightforward example of a full-stack web application, demonstrating key concepts of web development with Django.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations**:
  - **Add** new to-do items.
  - **View** a list of all to-do items.
  - **Mark** items as complete or incomplete (toggle).
  - **Delete** items from the list.
- **Database Persistence**: To-do items are stored in a SQLite database.
- **Clean UI**: A simple and intuitive user interface built with HTML.
- **Sorted Views**: To-do items are automatically sorted by their due date.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories and files:

```
.
├── db.sqlite3         # The SQLite database file for the project.
├── manage.py          # A command-line utility for interacting with the Django project.
├── templates/
│   └── home.html      # The HTML template for the main to-do list page.
├── todo_project/      # The main Django project configuration directory.
│   ├── settings.py    # Project settings (database, installed apps, etc.).
│   └── urls.py        # Project-level URL routing.
└── todos/             # The Django app for handling to-do list logic.
    ├── models.py      # Defines the database schema for a to-do item.
    ├── views.py       # Contains the business logic for handling requests.
    ├── admin.py       # Configuration for the Django admin interface.
    └── migrations/    # Database migration files generated by Django.
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8 or newer recommended)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python's package installer)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository** (or download the source code):
    If this project is under version control, clone it. Otherwise, navigate into the project directory.

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

    - **On macOS and Linux (using wsl.exe)**:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - **On Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell)**:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install Django and any other required packages.

    ```bash
    pip install Django
    ```

4.  **Apply Database Migrations**:
    This command creates the database schema based on your app's models.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server**:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2.  **View the Application**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

You should now see the to-do list application running!

## Running Tests

To ensure the application is working correctly, you can run the built-in tests:

```bash
python manage.py test
```
