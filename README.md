# My AI Development Projects

This repository serves as a central collection for all of my projects and experiments related to Artificial Intelligence and software development. Each sub-directory within this repository represents a standalone project.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to house a variety of AI-related projects, ranging from simple scripts and tutorials to more complex, full-stack applications. It acts as a personal space for learning, experimentation, and showcasing my work.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects currently contained in this repository. Each project is self-contained and has its own detailed `README.md` file with specific setup and usage instructions.

- **`01-todo/`**: A classic To-Do list application built with Python and the Django web framework. This project serves as a foundational example of web development principles.

_(More projects will be added to this list as they are developed.)_

## Getting Started

To explore a specific project, please navigate into its directory and consult the `README.md` file located there for detailed instructions on how to set it up, install dependencies, and run the application.
